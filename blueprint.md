# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This is a simple web application that generates random lottery numbers. The user can click a button to generate a new set of numbers and view the history of generated numbers.

## Features

*   Generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   Display the generated numbers in a visually appealing way.
*   Keep a history of generated numbers.

## Design

*   **Layout:** A clean and modern single-page layout.
*   **Styling:** Uses modern CSS with drop shadows for a "lifted" effect, CSS variables for theming, and a subtle background texture.
*   **Components:** Uses a Web Component to display the lottery numbers.

## Current Plan

1.  **`index.html`**: Set up the basic HTML structure with a title, a container for the app, a button to generate numbers, and an area to display them.
2.  **`style.css`**: Add CSS for a modern and visually appealing design, including a "lifted" look, CSS variables, and background texture.
3.  **`main.js`**: Implement the logic for generating unique random numbers, handling button clicks, displaying the numbers, and keeping a history. Use a Web Component for the number display.
